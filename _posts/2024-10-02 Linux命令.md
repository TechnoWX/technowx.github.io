> 初学Linux，记录一下常用代码

先在开头贴一下[Markdown语法链接](https://sspai.com/post/25137)，刚开始学着用，容易忘
## Basics
`pwd`-print working directory

`cd`-access directory
&emsp; `cd ~` = `cd`
&emsp; `cd ..`   返回上一级(..为上一级标识，可以用在`nano ../file2.txt`,`ls ..`等命
&emsp; 令中)
&emsp; `cd -`   go to the last directory you were in

`ls`-list
&emsp; `ls -lah` = `ll` -list long format, all, human readable number
&emsp; `ls Test/`  used when Test is not the current working directory

`sudo`-super user

`man ls`-manual for list command for flag
## Directory & Files
• Manage directory
`mkdir Test`-make directory Test
`rmdir Test/`-only when directory is empty
&emsp; `rm -rf Test/`-remove recursively and forcefully, dangerous command

• Manage files
`touch file1.txt`-simply create a blank file
`nano file2.txt`-create and edit a file
`cat file2.txt`-display file content

`mv file1.txt Test/`
&emsp; `mv Test test`-rename
`cp file2.txt Test/`
`rm Test/file2.txt`
`ln -s <path to the file/folder to be linked> <the path of the link to be created>`-symbolic Link (like shortcuts)

• Manage file permission
`chmod 755 file1.txt`-to change file permissions
`nano script.sh`-create a shell script(Shell scripting is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks.)
`./script.sh`-print shell script
`chmod +x script.sh`-gain access permission
you can add alias in the `.bashrc`, and use `source ~/.bashrc` to restart bash

## Find
• Find program
`which firefox`-finding programs
`whereis firefox`-finding programs and its libraries

• Find string
`locate firefox`-find anything contains the string “firefox”
&emsp; `sudo updatedb`-update database for locate command
`sudo find / -iname linux`-find in the root directory in Linux, regardless of case sensitivity

• Find word in a file
`grep ‘alias’ .bashrc`-find a specific word in the file

## Print
•Display sentences
`echo “Hello world”`
`printf “1\n2\n3”`
`printf “1\n2\n3” > file1.txt`-write into the file

• Selective display of files
`less .bashrc`-better than cat for reading long files, type 'q' to quit
`head .bashrc`-first ten lines of the file
&emsp; `head -n 15 .bashrc`-first 15 lines
`tail .bashrc`-last ten lines of the file

## Processes & Threads
• Display processes:
`ps -aux`
`ps -aux | less`
`ps -aux | more`

• Search for a particular Linux process:
`pgrep firefox`
`ps - aux | grep firefox`

• Linux resource usage:
`top`
`htop`

• Kill a process:
`kill <pid>`
`pkill firefox`

• Check threads of a process:
`pgrep -w firefox`
`top -H -p <pid>`
## Installation and update 
`sudo apt install mlocate`-to give the administrator to install mlocate
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`-update for updating library(after installation), upgrade for apps
`wget https://somelinux.com/new-release.iso`
## Others
`history`-show bash history
&emsp; `!84`-run the 84th command in the history

&emsp;`apt update`
&emsp;`sudo !!`
&emsp; = `sudo apt update`-'!!' for the last command

`ping google.com`-check network connection

`kill program name or number`
&emsp; `kill all`
&emsp; `xkill-fps`

`ls -l | sed “s/[aeio]/u/g” | sort`-| pipe the result of ls into sed command, and then pipe into sort command

`date`
`cal`-calendar
`bc`-basic caluculator
